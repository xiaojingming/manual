# Run prompts on a schedule

> Use /loop and the cron scheduling tools to run prompts repeatedly, poll for status, or set one-time reminders within a CSC session.

Scheduled tasks let CSC re-run a prompt automatically on an interval. Use them to poll a deployment, babysit a PR, check back on a long-running build, or remind yourself to do something later in the session. To react to events as they happen instead of polling.

Tasks are session-scoped: they live in the current CSC process and are gone when you exit.

## Compare scheduling options

CSC offers two ways to schedule recurring work:

|                            | Cloud | `/loop` |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| Runs on                    | Anthropic cloud                  | Your machine                   |
| Requires machine on        | No                               | Yes                            |
| Requires open session      | No                               | Yes                            |
| Persistent across restarts | Yes                              | No (session-scoped)            |
| Access to local files      | No (fresh clone)                 | Yes                            |
| MCP servers                | Connectors configured per task   | Inherits from session          |
| Permission prompts         | No (runs autonomously)           | Inherits from session          |
| Customizable schedule      | Via `/schedule` in the CLI       | Yes                            |
| Minimum interval           | 1 hour                           | 1 minute                       |

## Run a prompt repeatedly with /loop

The `/loop` built-in skill is the quickest way to run a prompt on repeat while the session stays open. Both the interval and the prompt are optional, and what you provide determines how the loop behaves.

| What you provide          | Example                     | What happens                                                                                                  |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Interval and prompt       | `/loop 5m check the deploy` | Your prompt runs on a fixed schedule                                              |
| Prompt only               | `/loop check the deploy`    | Your prompt runs at an interval CSC chooses each iteration              |
| Interval only, or nothing | `/loop`                     | The built-in maintenance prompt runs, or your `loop.md` if one exists |

You can also pass another command as the prompt, for example `/loop 20m /review-pr 1234`, to re-run a packaged workflow each iteration.

### Run on a fixed interval

When you supply an interval, CSC converts it to a cron expression, schedules the job, and confirms the cadence and job ID.

```text
/loop 5m check if the deployment finished and tell me what happened
```

The interval can lead the prompt as a bare token like `30m`, or trail it as a clause like `every 2 hours`. Supported units are `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, `h` for hours, and `d` for days.

Seconds are rounded up to the nearest minute since cron has one-minute granularity. Intervals that don't map to a clean cron step, such as `7m` or `90m`, are rounded to the nearest interval that does and CSC tells you what it picked.

### Let CSC choose the interval

When you omit the interval, CSC chooses one dynamically instead of running on a fixed cron schedule. After each iteration it picks a delay between one minute and one hour based on what it observed: short waits while a build is finishing or a PR is active, longer waits when nothing is pending. The chosen delay and the reason for it are printed at the end of each iteration.

The example below checks CI and review comments, with CSC waiting longer between iterations once the PR goes quiet:

```text
/loop check whether CI passed and address any review comments
```

When you ask for a dynamic `/loop` schedule, CSC may use the Monitor tool directly. Monitor runs a background script and streams each output line back, which avoids polling altogether and is often more token-efficient and responsive than re-running a prompt on an interval.

A dynamically scheduled loop appears in your scheduled task list like any other task, so you can list or cancel it the same way. The jitter rules don't apply to it, but the seven-day expiry does: the loop ends automatically seven days after you start it.

> **Note:** On Bedrock, Vertex AI, and Microsoft Foundry, a prompt with no interval runs on a fixed 10-minute schedule instead.

### Run the built-in maintenance prompt

When you omit the prompt, CSC uses a built-in maintenance prompt instead of one you supply. On each iteration it works through the following, in order:

* continue any unfinished work from the conversation
* tend to the current branch's pull request: review comments, failed CI runs, merge conflicts
* run cleanup passes such as bug hunts or simplification when nothing else is pending

CSC does not start new initiatives outside that scope, and irreversible actions such as pushing or deleting only proceed when they continue something the transcript already authorized.

```text
/loop
```

A bare `/loop` runs this prompt at a dynamically chosen interval. Add an interval, for example `/loop 15m`, to run it on a fixed schedule instead. To replace the built-in prompt with your own default, see Customize the default prompt with loop.md.

> **Note:** On Bedrock, Vertex AI, and Microsoft Foundry, `/loop` with no prompt prints the usage message instead of starting the maintenance loop.

### Customize the default prompt with loop.md

A `loop.md` file replaces the built-in maintenance prompt with your own instructions. It defines a single default prompt for bare `/loop`, not a list of separate scheduled tasks, and is ignored whenever you supply a prompt on the command line. To schedule additional prompts alongside it, use `/loop <prompt>` or ask CSC directly.

CSC looks for the file in two locations and uses the first one it finds.

| Path                | Scope                                                            |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.claude/loop.md`   | Project-level. Takes precedence when both files exist.           |
| `~/.claude/loop.md` | User-level. Applies in any project that does not define its own. |

The file is plain Markdown with no required structure. Write it as if you were typing the `/loop` prompt directly. The following example keeps a release branch healthy:

```markdown title=".claude/loop.md"
Check the `release/next` PR. If CI is red, pull the failing job log,
diagnose, and push a minimal fix. If new review comments have arrived,
address each one and resolve the thread. If everything is green and
quiet, say so in one line.
```

Edits to `loop.md` take effect on the next iteration, so you can refine the instructions while a loop is running. When no `loop.md` exists in either location, the loop falls back to the built-in maintenance prompt. Keep the file concise: content beyond 25,000 bytes is truncated.

## Set a one-time reminder

For one-shot reminders, describe what you want in natural language instead of using `/loop`. CSC schedules a single-fire task that deletes itself after running.

```text
remind me at 3pm to push the release branch
```

```text
in 45 minutes, check whether the integration tests passed
```

CSC pins the fire time to a specific minute and hour using a cron expression and confirms when it will fire.

## Manage scheduled tasks

Ask CSC in natural language to list or cancel tasks, or reference the underlying tools directly.

```text
what scheduled tasks do I have?
```

```text
cancel the deploy check job
```

Under the hood, CSC uses these tools:

| Tool         | Purpose                                                                                                         |
| :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CronCreate` | Schedule a new task. Accepts a 5-field cron expression, the prompt to run, and whether it recurs or fires once. |
| `CronList`   | List all scheduled tasks with their IDs, schedules, and prompts.                                                |
| `CronDelete` | Cancel a task by ID.                                                                                            |

Each scheduled task has an 8-character ID you can pass to `CronDelete`. A session can hold up to 50 scheduled tasks at once.

## How scheduled tasks run

The scheduler checks every second for due tasks and enqueues them at low priority. A scheduled prompt fires between your turns, not while CSC is mid-response. If CSC is busy when a task comes due, the prompt waits until the current turn ends.

All times are interpreted in your local timezone. A cron expression like `0 9 * * *` means 9am wherever you're running CSC, not UTC.

### Jitter

To avoid every session hitting the API at the same wall-clock moment, the scheduler adds a small deterministic offset to fire times:

* Recurring tasks fire up to 10% of their period late, capped at 15 minutes. An hourly job might fire anywhere from `:00` to `:06`.
* One-shot tasks scheduled for the top or bottom of the hour fire up to 90 seconds early.

The offset is derived from the task ID, so the same task always gets the same offset. If exact timing matters, pick a minute that is not `:00` or `:30`, for example `3 9 * * *` instead of `0 9 * * *`, and the one-shot jitter will not apply.

### Seven-day expiry

Recurring tasks automatically expire 7 days after creation. The task fires one final time, then deletes itself. This bounds how long a forgotten loop can run. If you need a recurring task to last longer, cancel and recreate it before it expires, or use Cloud scheduled tasks or Desktop scheduled tasks for durable scheduling.

## Cron expression reference

`CronCreate` accepts standard 5-field cron expressions: `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`. All fields support wildcards (`*`), single values (`5`), steps (`*/15`), ranges (`1-5`), and comma-separated lists (`1,15,30`).

| Example        | Meaning                      |
| :------------- | :--------------------------- |
| `*/5 * * * *`  | Every 5 minutes              |
| `0 * * * *`    | Every hour on the hour       |
| `7 * * * *`    | Every hour at 7 minutes past |
| `0 9 * * *`    | Every day at 9am local       |
| `0 9 * * 1-5`  | Weekdays at 9am local        |
| `30 14 15 3 *` | March 15 at 2:30pm local     |

Day-of-week uses `0` or `7` for Sunday through `6` for Saturday. Extended syntax like `L`, `W`, `?`, and name aliases such as `MON` or `JAN` is not supported.

When both day-of-month and day-of-week are constrained, a date matches if either field matches. This follows standard vixie-cron semantics.

## Disable scheduled tasks

Set `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CRON=1` in your environment to disable the scheduler entirely. The cron tools and `/loop` become unavailable, and any already-scheduled tasks stop firing. See Environment variables for the full list of disable flags.

## Limitations

Session-scoped scheduling has inherent constraints:

* Tasks only fire while CSC is running and idle. Closing the terminal or letting the session exit cancels everything.
* No catch-up for missed fires. If a task's scheduled time passes while CSC is busy on a long-running request, it fires once when CSC becomes idle, not once per missed interval.
* No persistence across restarts. Restarting CSC clears all session-scoped tasks.
